This project was developed as part of a Data Science Workshop, focusing on leveraging machine learning to predict crop yields. The workshop explored the intersection of data science and agriculture, addressing critical challenges such as food security and sustainable agricultural practices.

Participants worked on building regression models to predict yields for the world's top 10 most consumed crops using weather conditions and historical data.
